There are a lot of changes that have to be made to a corporate environment to accommodate all of the changes that are to be audited. Several of the things can be done via group policy. The group policies are documented well enough by Netwrix. The part that came to a quick slow down when Netwrix requires a change to the audit permis... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Speeding up System Center OS Deployment</title><link href="https://www.elusivecode.net/posts/SCCM-OSD-Speed/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Speeding up System Center OS Deployment" /><published>2019-01-29T00:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2021-01-30T12:53:20-05:00</updated> <id>https://www.elusivecode.net/posts/SCCM-OSD-Speed/</id> <content src="https://www.elusivecode.net/posts/SCCM-OSD-Speed/" /> <author> <name>Matt Parker</name> </author> <category term="Sysadmin" /> <category term="Automation" /> <summary>     Some of the goals of the exercise was to add some automation to a task sequence and also speed up the results so that to not hinder the technicians that do the deployments.     We wanted to add bit-locker encryption to the task sequence, with full disk encryption to add security to reused disks for re-images.

There was a constant slow to resolve DNS when browsing the web. The internet connectivity on location was a 500/500 fiber with modern firewalls.
